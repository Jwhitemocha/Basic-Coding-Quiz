Coding Quiz 

For? 

Timed Quiz about basic front-end knowledge with recorded high scores on your local storage.


HTML : 

Used for creating different divs for the various ID's used in JavaScript. 

CSS : 
Was only used to create the .hide property and style the Timer, mainly decorated with Bootstrap. 

JavaScript : 

Created tons of consts, using Jquery I linked the consts to the ID's in HTML. I put the Questions and Answers into one object, to lessen the code I would have to write in HTML and JS. I used functions to place the text into the proper buttons on the HTML. Using localStorage I was able to log user's "high scores" so they could see that in a list.

Problems : 

I had a problem with the .hide property in CSS, where I wasn't able to remove the .hide class. So I created different divs for each page instead of trying to do it all in one. Using seperate ID's for each page, I was able to properly target the correct page to hide and show.
